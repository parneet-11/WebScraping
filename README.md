# Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup (Python)

This repository contains a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook that demonstrates **basic web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup**.  
The notebook shows how to fetch a webpage, parse its HTML, and extract useful data in a structured way.

## What This Project Does

Web scraping is useful when data is not available through an API or direct download.  
In this notebook, I explore how to:

- Send HTTP requests to a webpage
- Parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup
- Extract specific elements from the page
- Store the scraped data in a structured format
- Export the results for further use or analysis

This project is meant as a **learning and practice exercise** for understanding the fundamentals of web scraping.

## Tools & Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used:

- `requests` – to fetch webpage content  
- `beautifulsoup4` – to parse and navigate HTML
